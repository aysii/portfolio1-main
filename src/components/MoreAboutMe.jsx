             I treat everyone with respect and humility. Even though I'm not the best academically, I always do my hardest. 
             In order to have a decent job and repay my parents for everything they have done for me while I have been in school,
             I also want to become proficient in my profession. In order to save them from having to continue working as they age, I want to provide them 
             with a better life while they are still with me. Developing my riding skills and competing internationally to represent my birth country are only 
             two of my many aspirations for my parents and me. In addition, my father has always wanted me to join the military. Also, my father has always wanted me to join the military. 
             I will thus take the test to become a soldier after completing my course. I want my family to live in a large home and be financially secure.

                My mother's name is Evangelene, One of the most strong and affectionate individuals I have ever encountered is my mother. She has consistently been there for us, providing us with unwavering love, patience, and care. She continues to do everything she can for our family, even at difficult circumstances, without complaining. Her strength is quiet but powerful, and her sacrifices often go unnoticed, yet they are the foundation of our lives. I admire her deeply, and Iâ€™m so grateful for everything she has done for me and my younger sister.

                My father's name is Jimmy. I love him so much because he is one of the people who works hard to support me and my siblings, and helps us continue our studies. He is a dedicated, powerful, and unselfish parent who perseveres through hardship.  Every day, his love and sacrifices motivate me to work even harder and give it my all.  Having a father like him makes me incredibly thankful, and one of my greatest goals is to honor him by returning all that he has done for us.
